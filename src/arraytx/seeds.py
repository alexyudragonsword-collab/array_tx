"""Seed derivation: one ``seed`` in the config, one independent stream per
element per impairment (invariant 5).

polar_tx's own random draws are positional on shared generators (its DTC
jitter and LO phase noise share one rng, its Monte Carlo draws in order), so
flipping one switch there shifts every later draw.  array_tx does not reach
into those; at the array layer every random quantity gets a stream of its own,
derived from ``numpy.random.SeedSequence`` so that

* element k's streams never overlap element k+1's (no ``seed + 1`` tricks),
* adding elements leaves the existing elements' draws unchanged
  (``spawn`` is indexed, not positional),
* a switch that turns an impairment off still consumes nothing from any
  other stream — because every stream is its own generator.  The owner of the
  switch draws and zeroes (see ``element.py``), so the draw itself is also
  stable.

The ``run`` and ``dpa_mismatch`` streams are handed to polar_tx as integer
seeds (its APIs take ints); the ``lo`` stream is shared by every element when
``element.lo.shared`` is true (one physical LO).
